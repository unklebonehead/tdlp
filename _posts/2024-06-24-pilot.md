In the pilot episode of The Digital Liberation Podcast, Unkle Bonehead discusses the importance of decentralization and self-hosting for online freedom and autonomy. TDL highlights the risks of centralization and control by large tech companies like Google, Facebook, and Amazon, who collect and sell personal data with and without consent and who also manipulate information.  
Decentralization, a solution to these issues, empowers individuals, promotes privacy and security, and fosters innovation. Self-hosting, storing and managing one's data on their own servers or devices, is a powerful companion to decentralization. By combining these concepts, individuals take back control of their digital domains, free from big tech's influence. Unkle Bonehead encourages listeners to join him on this journey to protect privacy, ensure online freedom, and make the digital world a better place.
